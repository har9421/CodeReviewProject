# Intelligent Code Review Bot - Advanced Features

## Overview

The Code Review Bot has been enhanced with intelligent learning capabilities, performance optimizations, and adaptive rule management. The bot now learns from each PR analysis and continuously improves its effectiveness.

## üß† Learning System

### Core Learning Features

1. **Rule Effectiveness Tracking**

   - Monitors how often each rule finds valid issues
   - Tracks developer acceptance/rejection of rule suggestions
   - Calculates confidence scores for each rule

2. **Adaptive Rule Management**

   - Automatically adjusts rule confidence based on historical data
   - Disables low-performing rules
   - Generates new rules based on common patterns

3. **Developer Feedback Integration**
   - Collects feedback on rule suggestions
   - Learns from developer responses
   - Improves rule accuracy over time

### Learning Data Storage

The bot stores learning data in JSON files:

- `learning-data.json` - Historical analysis data and rule effectiveness
- `adaptive-rules.json` - Dynamically generated rules

- Reduces noise from false positives
- Focuses on high-impact issues

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked

- Analysis execution times
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates and types
- Throughput measurements

### Alert System

- High error rate alerts

## üîÑ Learning Workflow

1. **Analysis Phase**

   - Bot analyzes PR using current rules
   - Records analysis metrics and timing
   - Applies intelligent filtering

2. **Comment Phase**

   - Posts prioritized comments with confidence indicators
   - Uses adaptive delays to avoid overwhelming developers
   - Tracks comment success rates

3. **Learning Phase**

   - Collects developer feedback on suggestions
   - Updates rule effectiveness scores
   - Generates learning insights

4. **Optimization Phase**
   - Automatically optimizes rules based on data
   - Disables low-performing rules
   - Generates recommendations for rule improvements

## üéõÔ∏è Management Commands

### Rule Management

```bash
# View current rule effectiveness
curl -X GET http://localhost:5002/api/feedback/rule-effectiveness

# Trigger rule optimization
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/feedback/optimize-rules

# Get learning insights
curl -X GET http://localhost:5002/api/feedback/insights
```

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Get performance report
curl -X GET http://localhost:5002/api/performance/report

# Check system health
curl -X GET http://localhost:5002/api/performance/health

# Reset metrics
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/performance/reset
```

## üìã Feedback Collection

### Submitting Feedback

```bash
# Submit feedback on a specific issue
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/feedback/issue-feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "issueId": "issue-123",
    "ruleId": "no-console-writeline",
    "filePath": "src/Program.cs",
    "lineNumber": 15,
    "feedbackType": "Accepted",
    "comment": "Good catch, will fix this"
  }'
