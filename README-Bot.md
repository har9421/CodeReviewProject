# Intelligent C# Code Review Bot for Azure DevOps

An intelligent, AI-powered code review bot that installs directly into your Azure DevOps organization as an extension. The bot automatically reviews C# .NET Core code in pull requests and provides intelligent, contextual feedback.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install the Bot Extension

Run the installation script:

```powershell
.\install-bot.ps1 -PublisherId "your-publisher-id" -OrganizationUrl "https://dev.azure.com/yourorg"
```

### 2. Configure Webhooks

After installation, configure webhooks for your project:

```powershell
.\configure-webhook.ps1 -OrganizationUrl "https://dev.azure.com/yourorg" -ProjectName "YourProject" -PersonalAccessToken "your-pat"
```

### 3. Set Up Coding Standards

Create a JSON file with your coding standards and host it at a publicly accessible URL:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "method-naming",
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "Method names should be in PascalCase",
      "languages": ["csharp"],
      "applies_to": "method_declaration"
    },
    {
      "id": "async-naming",
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "Async methods should end with 'Async' suffix",
      "languages": ["csharp"],
      "applies_to": "method_declaration"
    }
  ]
}
```
